-->Telnet (short for Telecommunication Network) is a network protocol used to establish a remote 
connection to a server or device over a TCP/IP network. 
-->It operates on port 23 by default and allows users to access and manage remote systems via a command-line interface (CLI). 
-->Although it is a simple and lightweight protocol, Telnet is considered insecure because data, including passwords, 
is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception. 
-->Due to its lack of encryption, it has largely been replaced by SSH (Secure Shell) for secure remote access. 
-->Telnet is still useful for testing and troubleshooting network services, as it can connect to any server and 
interact with various network protocols. 
-->In Linux, the Telnet client can be used with the telnet command to initiate a connection to a specified IP address 
or hostname. 
-->Despite being deprecated in favor of more secure alternatives, Telnet remains an important tool in legacy systems
 and educational environments.
